## Miscellaneous R code from AU-ENVS Bioinformatics

This repository contains miscellaneous scripts, and useful R code. It is distributed in the form of an R package. So, you just need to install it (and reinstall it to update it). 

As this package is currently under development for internal use, it's not in CRAN and you have to install it from GitHub by

```r
devtools::install_github("AU-ENVS-Bioinformatics/RauENVS")
```

You can start using it by loading the library

```r
library(RauENVS)
```

and find RMarkdown templates in Rstudio. New file -> RMarkdown -> Template
