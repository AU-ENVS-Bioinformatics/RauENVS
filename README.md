## Miscellaneous R code from AU-ENVS Bioinformatics

This repository contains RMarkdown notebooks for various purposes of the  High Throughput Sequencing Center of the Department of Environmental Science, Aarhus University. Please, take a look at the documentation to see what's available. 

We distribute these notebooks as an R package. So, you just need to install it (and reinstall it to update it). As this package is currently under development for internal use, it's not in CRAN and you have to install it from GitHub by

```r
devtools::install_github("AU-ENVS-Bioinformatics/RauENVS")
```

You can start using it by loading the library

```r
library(RauENVS)
```

and find RMarkdown templates in Rstudio. New file -> RMarkdown -> Template
